summary: ser2net - Serial port to network proxy
description: |
  This daemon allows telnet and tcp sessions to be established with a
  host's serial ports. Combined with a terminal emulator, this can be a
  very simple means to configure network devices or other equipment with
  a serial port. This is remarkably similar to the reverse telnet
  feature of some Cisco routers.

  You will need to connect the raw-usb interface using:
      $ sudo snap connect ser2net-plars:raw-usb

  *note: If you are on classic and don't have a gadget with support for 
         the serial-port interface, you should install with --classic

  Example usage:
      $ ser2net-plars.config-get > ser2net.yaml
        <edit the config>
      $ cat /tmp/ser2net.yaml |sudo /snap/bin/ser2net-plars.config-set
      $ sudo snap restart ser2net-plars.ser2net
